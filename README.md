# FFDB
A python script that compares inputted strings to a customisable flat file database

This script will load each line from any file within the specified database directory into a list, and allow you to search the list whilst returning what number in the list the string is.

The Spell Checking Oriented Word Lists (SCOWL) comes pre-bundled within default flat file database with this script. [Learn more about SCOWL](scowl-readme.txt)
